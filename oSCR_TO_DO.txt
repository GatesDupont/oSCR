--------- East to do or critical --------------------------------

Hack predict.oSCR to compute ESA (make a summary method perhaps)

print warning/messages for oSCR.fit objectects:
   1. density is per pixel
   2. Nhat = 
   3. if dist=ecol note that trimS or the buffer might have to change
        [should be in help file too]

allow for sessions with no captures......

change type=multicatch to be just another encounter model....

update nybear data so that all data objects are correct (trap
locations are not)

model average predictions. predict.oSCR should take a fitList....(optional)

OUT OF DATE -- update slowworm analysis example

OUT OF DATE -- update microtus analysis example

--------- Moderate ----------------------------------------------

Farm out design matrix creation

----------Difficult and/or low priority--------------------------
need to allow covariate * sex interactions

new set of likelihood functions for when there is no temporal
variation in p. NOTE: this will cause problems with AIC comparisons....

make oSCR faster!
 - efficient trimming of the state space for all-zero ind (requires irregular matrix indexing)

Update the mander workflow and add as a vignette.

---------- DONE ----------------

telemetry: DONE (thanks Dan!)

multi-core functionality: DONE!
