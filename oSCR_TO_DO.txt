need to allow covariate * sex interactions

new set of likelihood functions for when there is no temporal
variation in p

auxiliary telemetry data

flesh out the help files

make oSCR faster!
 - efficient trimming of the state space for all-zero ind (requires irregular matrix indexing)

Update the mander workflow and add as a vignette.

Farm out design matrix creation

Hack predict.oSCR to compute ESA (make a summary method perhaps)

print warning/messages for oSCR.fit objectects:
   1. density is per pixel
   2. Nhat = 
   3. if dist=ecol note that trimS or the buffer might have to change
        [should be in help file too]


allow for sessions with no captures......



telemetyr
telemetry data plan:

1. add rsfDF to make.scrFrame.  This object can have different
resolution than state-space. 

If this is provided then:

 1a. every covariate in rsfDF gets auto-matically converted to a
 trapCov using "rsf2traps" or similar
 
 1b. currently telemetry.processor() can convert rsfDF covariates to
 cell frequencies needed to compute the likelihood. This function
 should be called within the make.scrFrame call. 

2. there are TWO options for modeling RSF covariates:

 2.1:  we could have an RSF=TRUE option which, if TRUE, will use any
 covariate in the rsfDF as a covariate on the telemetry data.  This
 seems straightforward.....??

 should produce a warning message or someting to make sure user knows
 that only covariates in rsfDF are used.

 XXXXX Dan: I still think option 2.1 is best.  Then when RSF=TRUE, you check that names in rsfDF are terms in the p0 model.




 2.2: we could add a whole new formula to the function call.  This
 seems more difficult. 

3. The likelihood bit of the telemetry data is easy enough to add.
