--------- East to do or critical --------------------------------

From SI 2017 workshop:
   1. include  time-varying  covariates  in TDF so they can be processed  with
   data2oscr
   2. include dependent behavioral response
   3. Beardata --> put TDF in the data not just trap locs
   4. make.scrFRame: traps out of order could be a problem!!
   5. include simulation function
   

order print(out) same as out$outStats and same as order of starting
values!!

Hack predict.oSCR to compute ESA (make a summary method perhaps)
  [almost done]

Fix predict.oSCR to allow for irregular statepsace grid.

We really need a 'predict.connectivity(model, costDF, ssDF, type = c (
"potential", "dwc")[1]) function.

print warning/messages for oSCR.fit objectects:
   1. density is per pixel
   2. Nhat = 
   3. if dist=ecol note that trimS or the buffer might have to change
        [should be in help file too]

**** Add a type of behavioral response .. global and dependent among
individuals

Allow for sessions with no captures......

change type=multicatch to be just another encounter model....

update mander analysis to include multicatch=TRUE

in print() for fit objects, print the type of encounter model (B, P,
MN)

update nybear data so that all data objects are correct (trap
locations are not)

model average predictions. predict.oSCR should take a fitList....(optional)

OUT OF DATE -- update slowworm analysis example

OUT OF DATE -- update microtus analysis example

predict.oSCR should have option of not using trimS even if model fit
did use trimS

--------- Moderate ----------------------------------------------

make a "Squeeze" function which will reduce a full scrFrame to include
only days where at least 1 trap was operated (should make things a tad
bit faster too in large camera trap studies). 

Farm out design matrix creation

----------Difficult and/or low priority--------------------------
need to allow covariate * sex interactions

new set of likelihood functions for when there is no temporal
variation in p. NOTE: this will cause problems with AIC comparisons....

make oSCR faster!
 - efficient trimming of the state space for all-zero ind (requires irregular matrix indexing)

Update the mander workflow and add as a vignette.

---------- DONE ----------------

telemetry: DONE (thanks Dan!)

multi-core functionality: DONE!
