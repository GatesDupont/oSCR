To build the R package, install RTools:
http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/

Make sure it changes your PATH. To verify, open a command prompt
and type: PATH. It should look something like this:
PATH=c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\perl\bin;c:\Rtools\MinGW\bin;c:\Rtools\MinGW64\bin;C:\ProgramFiles (x86)\MiKTeX 2.8\miktex\bin;C:\Program Files\R\R-2.12.1\bin\x64;ETC...

Move to the scrbook directory using something like:
cd F:\Rpackage-gSCR

Now build and install the package by typing:
R CMD build gSCR
R CMD INSTALL gSCR_0.10.tar.gz

or  to make a .zip file

R CMD INSTALL gSCR_0.10.tar.gz --build


If your path isn't set correctly you might need to do this:

"c:/Program Fiels/R/R-3.0.1/bin/x64/R" CMD build gSCR

and so forth
